- How many times do you repetitively complete a task before considering automation? Automation should be looked at when a couple criteria are met:  

  - The task is easy enough to automate.
  - Automation will actually simplify the problem, not create new ones.
  - The task will live on for a significant amount of time
  - The automation solution cannot have a bus factor of 1.
  - The process should reveal insights into the project, and not hide them.

- How do you get more documentation on your project?  
Documentation is a common pain for most developers. Easy ways to get it moving in your project is to require JSDoc comments (focusing on JS only) for all public functions in the code they are submitting pull requests on. For those on the creative side of things with CSS, have them focus on create a living style guide for the project. The project/company should be using an online documentation system, such as Confluence, where devs can easily group together standards or flows about the project. Link to the pages of the documentation in JIRA tickets or in email threads (Instead of typing out the documenation via email). A link to "living" documentation is always best... that way consumers know that they can always expect that to be the correct location for any changes. Force people to put information on those pages instead of shuffling them around in emails or chats.

- How to balance legacy processes with industry best practices. Succumb or adapt and overcome? Start looking at ways to SLOWLY introduce the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) into your day-to-day work. Basically, look at little ways to introduce the concepts... Continuous integration, starting a daily standup for your team, and paired programming. Start with these things slowly and show them how they can benefit the project.
