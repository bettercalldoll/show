# Better Call Doll!
A weekly Twitch stream ([https://www.twitch.tv/bettercalldoll](https://www.twitch.tv/bettercalldoll)) that focuses on being a better development lead, or a developer in general. New shows every Monday that start around 9PM if you want to catch it live and partake in the chat.  Look in the [videos](https://www.twitch.tv/bettercalldoll/videos/all) section to see past episodes... just know that it looks like Twitch deletes everything older than 2 weeks!

## Have a burning question about web development that you want answered?

This is the place to ask it! For those who can't make the Twitch streams feel free to submit a PR to the QUESTIONS.md with your question added and we will discus it during the next live stream.  The answer will be posted with the show notes.
